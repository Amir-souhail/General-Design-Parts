# Y10A ROCT 1435-99 ‚Äì Reverse Engineered Part

This project documents the reverse engineering and 3D reconstruction of a mechanical component titled **Y10A**, based on technical drawing ROCT (GOST) 1435-99. The part was reverse engineered by interpreting a 2D drawing found online, and remodeled as a fully parametric, manufacturable 3D CAD model using SOLIDWORKS.
