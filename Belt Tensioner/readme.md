## ⚙️ Function & Application

The belt tensioner assembly ensures proper tension is maintained on a belt drive system. It helps:
- Reduce vibration and belt flutter
- Minimize slippage and power loss
- Extend belt and pulley lifespan
- Allow for automatic or manual tension adjustments

### 🔧 Use Cases
- Automotive engines (timing or serpentine belts)
- Conveyor belt systems
- Agricultural machinery
- Industrial automation setups

---

## 🧱 Material Suggestions

- **Frame & Base:** Mild Steel or Cast Iron (for rigidity)
- **Pulley:** Nylon (for noise reduction) or Steel (for durability)
- **Bushing:** Bronze or Brass (low friction & wear resistance)
- **Shaft & Key:** EN8 / EN24 Hardened Steel
