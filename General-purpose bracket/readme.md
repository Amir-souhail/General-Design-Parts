## Overview

This project contains the SolidWorks files for a parametric sheet metal bracket, based on the "Sheet Metal Exercise 006" drawing by Jairam Kumar. The goal was to accurately model the part using SolidWorks Sheet Metal tools, applying correct bends and features to generate a manufacturing-ready model and flat pattern.

## Specifications

- **Material:** Steel
- **Thickness:** 2.0 mm
- **Bend Radius:** 2.0 mm
- **Features:** Mounting holes, slots, weight-reduction cutouts, and 90Â° flanges.

## Files

- `Sheet_Metal_Bracket.SLDPRT` - Main SolidWorks part file.
- `Sheet_Metal_Bracket.SLDDRW` - Technical drawing.
- `Sheet_Metal_Bracket.STEP` - Neutral 3D format for viewing in other software.
- `Drawing.pdf` - PDF of the technical drawing.
