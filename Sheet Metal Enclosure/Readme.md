# Sheet Metal Enclosure – Reverse Engineering Project

## 📌 Overview
This project showcases the **reverse engineering** of a **Sheet Metal Enclosure**.  
The 2D drawing reference was sourced from **Mahtabalam Khan’s Pinterest profile**, who also published a related YouTube video. Using that drawing as a base reference, the enclosure was **independently recreated in 3D CAD** without following his specific modeling approach.  

This project demonstrates the ability to take incomplete design references and generate a **manufacturable 3D model** using SolidWorks sheet metal tools.

## 🧩 Key Features
- Reverse engineered from a **2D technical drawing**  
- Modeled entirely in **3D CAD (SolidWorks)**  
- Uses **sheet metal operations** such as bends, cutouts, flanges, and fillets  
- Fully dimensioned 2D drawing with **section views A–H**  
- Scaled at **2:1** for clear documentation  
- Applies **geometric tolerancing principles**

---

## ⚙️ Applications
- Electrical housings and junction boxes  
- Robotics and automation protective casings  
- Mechanical subassembly covers  
- General-purpose protective enclosures

## 🧱 Material Suggestions
| Component | Suggested Material     | Reason |
|-----------|------------------------|--------|
| Enclosure Body | Mild Steel (CRCA) | Strong, easy to bend and weld |
| Alternative | Aluminum 5052/6061   | Lightweight, corrosion-resistant |
| High-End | Stainless Steel (304)   | Durable, chemical and weather resistant |

## 📐 Drawing Details
- **File:** `Sheet Metal Encloser.pdf`  
- **Scale:** 2:1  
- **Views:** Orthographic + Section views (A–H)  
- **Units:** Inches  
- **Tolerances:** Standard for sheet metal bending

## 📘 Sheet Metal Design Formulas (Quick Reference)

**1. Bend Allowance (BA):**  
BA = θ × (π/180) × (R + K × T)
- θ = Bend Angle (degrees)  
- R = Inside Bend Radius  
- T = Material Thickness  
- K = K-Factor (0.3–0.5 typically)  

**2. Bend Deduction (BD):**  
BD = 2 × (Leg Length) – Flat Length


**3. Flat Length (FL):**  
FL = (Leg 1 + Leg 2) – BD

**4. K-Factor:**  
K = t / T

- t = Distance from inside surface to Neutral Axis  
- T = Material Thickness

## 🎯 Educational Purpose
This reverse engineering project demonstrates how to:
- Interpret incomplete or reference drawings  
- Apply **sheet metal design knowledge** to regenerate accurate 3D models  
- Produce manufacturing-ready drawings with correct allowances and tolerances
