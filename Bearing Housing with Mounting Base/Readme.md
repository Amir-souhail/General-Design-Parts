# Bearing Housing with Mounting Base

## Overview

This project features a precisely engineered **Bearing Housing with a Mounting Base**, commonly used in mechanical assemblies that require shaft rotation with stable alignment and easy mounting to flat surfaces. The model was created in SOLIDWORKS based on provided 2D drawings and accurately represents industrial design practices.

## Project Details

- **Designer:** Amir Souhail  
- **Role:** Research and Development Engineer  
- **Affiliation:** Autonomous Underwater Vehicle, La Spezia, Italy  
- **Email:** amir.souhail@gmail.com  

## Description

The bearing housing is a robust mechanical part designed to support a rotating shaft and secure a bearing in place. It features a cylindrical housing section for the bearing and a wide rectangular base for rigid mounting.

### Key Features:

- **Precision Shaft Bore:** Provides accurate bearing alignment and minimizes vibration.
- **Mounting Flange:** Enables secure attachment to a base or structure.
- **Through-holes and counterbores:** Facilitate bolt and fastener integration.
- **Sectioned Design:** The sectional view (A–A) reveals key internal clearances and chamfers.

## Applications

This part can be used in various engineering applications, including:

- **Automated machinery**
- **Rotary equipment**
- **Conveyor systems**
- **Agricultural or industrial machines**
- **Custom robotics systems**

## Suggested Materials

- **Aluminum Alloy (6061-T6):** Lightweight, corrosion-resistant, and easy to machine.
- **Mild Steel (A36):** Durable and cost-effective for industrial use.
- **Cast Iron:** Excellent vibration damping for heavy-duty applications.

## Manufacturing Notes

- Can be machined via CNC milling and turning.
- Tolerances must be tightly controlled for bearing seat and bolt hole positions.
- Surface finish should be considered for the bore and contact surfaces.
